	abstract = {A key consideration in the interpretation of ground test data of electric propulsion devices purposed for spaceflight is understanding how facility-effects influence thruster operation. This understanding is critical to the prediction of actual thruster performance in space. The necessity of science-based predictions gleaned from ground tests are particularly critical at higher thruster power levels. Operation of engines at higher power levels in vacuum chambers leads to considerable elevation in background pressure, background plasma density, and backsputter rates. This review examines the influence of ground test facility effects on gridded ion thruster operation. Ground test operation is compared with flight data, where available, to obtain a clear picture of operational differences. Mitigation strategies to alleviate facility effects are also commented upon.},

	abstract = {One frequently obtains detailed dynamical information about interacting classical systems from “molecular dynamics” ({MD}) simulations, which require integrating Newton’s equations of motion over a long period of time starting from some initial conditions. One might be interested, for example, in following the motion of atoms in a fluid. As another example, astronomers might want to integrate the motion of the solar system for a long period of time, or consider the evolution of a galaxy by following the motions of its constituent stars. (In an astronomical setting,“molecular dynamics” simulations are called “N-body” simulations.) In this handout I will discuss an algorithm, called “leapfrog”, which is particularly suited for these simulations because (i) it is simple, and (ii) it has a sort of “global” stability (in technical jargon, the algorithm is “symplectic”). I will explain what this term means, and also discuss briefly some higher order symplectic algorithms.},

	abstract = {Direct numerical simulation of intense laser–solid interactions is still of great challenges, because of the many coupled atomic and plasma processes, such as ionization dynamics, collision among charged particles and collective electromagnetic fields, to name just a few. Here, we develop a new particle-in-cell ({PIC}) simulation code, which enables us to calculate laser–solid interactions in a more realistic way. This code is able to cover almost ‘all’ the coupled physical processes. As an application of the new code, the generation and transport of energetic electrons in front of and within the solid target when irradiated by intense laser beams are studied. For the considered case, in which laser intensity is

New additions include the ponderomotive force, tearing instabilities in resistive plasmas and the magnetorotational instability in accretion disks, charged particle acceleration by shocks, and a more in-depth look at nonlinear phenomena. A broad range of applications are explored: planetary magnetospheres and radiation belts, the confinement and stability of plasmas in fusion devices, the propagation of discontinuities and shock waves in the solar wind, and analysis of various types of plasma waves and instabilities that can occur in planetary magnetospheres and laboratory plasma devices. With step-by-step derivations and self-contained introductions to mathematical methods, this book is ideal as an advanced undergraduate to graduate-level textbook, or as a reference for researchers.},
